# Construction jobs analysis

By [Ben Welsh](mailto:ben.welsh@latimes.com)

The Los Angeles Times conducted an analysis of federal data to evaluate the makeup and pay of construction work. 

The analysis found that wages have been in decline nationwide for several decades. In LA County, this has coincided with a shift to a workforce made up overwhelmingly of Latinos, which leads a nationwide trend in the industry toward employing more Latino workers.

Those results were published in the April 20, 2017 story ["Immigrants flooded California construction. Worker pay sank. Hereâ€™s why"](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-construction-trump/).
